/// Canonical spelling of a source path.

/// `Finding.path` is part of the output contract: it is hashed into
/// `Finding.fingerprint`, which is what `--baseline` matches on and what SARIF
/// exports as `partialFingerprints`. So the same file must yield the same
/// string no matter how the corpus was named on the command line — `a.swift`,
/// `./a.swift` and `/abs/a.swift` are one file, analyzed once, fingerprinted
/// identically.
///
/// Without this, two things break. Fingerprints computed from a directory walk
/// (which absolutizes) differ from those computed from explicit file arguments
/// (which did not), so a baseline written by one invocation style suppresses
/// nothing under the other. And because the corpus is a set of strings, the
/// same file passed under two spellings entered it twice — the duplication
/// engine then reported it as an exact clone of itself.
enum SourcePath {
  /// The absolute, lexically standardized form — matching what the directory
  /// walk produces — with symlinks resolved, so a linked spelling and the real
  /// one are one corpus entry (a symlinked duplicate used to clone-match
  /// against itself), the reader's "regular file" check sees the target, and
  /// a scope entry spelled through /tmp matches a corpus under /private/tmp.
  ///
  /// `.standardized` is lexical on purpose: it collapses `.` and `..` without
  /// touching the filesystem, so canonicalizing a 2600-file corpus costs ~8 ms
  /// rather than 2600 `realpath` syscalls. The trade is that `..` is not
  /// resolved through a symlinked directory (`a/link/../b` standardizes to
  /// `a/b` even when `link` points elsewhere) — the same trade SwiftPM and
  /// SwiftLint make, and one no `git diff` output can trigger.
