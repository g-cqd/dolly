/// How a SARIF log names the file a location points at.
///
/// A SARIF `uri` is an RFC 3986 URI reference (SARIF 2.1.0 §3.10.1), and a
/// relative one is resolved against the base its `uriBaseId` names (§3.4.4).
/// A filesystem path is neither: `/Users/me/My Repo/A.swift` holds a space no
/// URI may, a `#` in a file name starts a fragment, so `Box#1.swift` reads as
/// `Box` — and a relative path with no base resolves against whatever the
/// reader guesses.
///
/// So a location takes one of two forms, the convention arcleak and deadwood
/// share:
///
/// - Relative to the `--relative-to` directory, with `uriBaseId` naming that
///   directory, when the file lies inside it and its relative path is made
///   only of characters a URI carries unescaped. That is nearly every path.
/// - Otherwise an absolute `file://` URI, percent-encoded as UTF-8.
///
/// A relative path is never percent-encoded, deliberately. Some readers take a
/// relative reference as a plain path, and would look for `My%20Dir/A.swift`
/// and find nothing; every reader decodes an absolute `file://` URI, so the
/// few paths that need escapes take that form instead.
